        description: 'In this project, we implemented encryption and decryption algorithms on images to send them securely to users using Socket Programming. We used the DES Algorithm and SHA Algorithm for the encryption process. The system allows users to protect sensitive images with strong encryption before transmission and enables recipients to decrypt them with the proper authorization.',
